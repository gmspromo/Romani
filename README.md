# Romani/Romany Genealogy

This is a project that heavily utilizes MySQL to store baptisms, marriages and burials of Romany travellers in the United Kingdom for the years 1500-1900 (give or take). MySQL is also used to store location information (location name, a brief description of the location and the lat/lng) and Church/Cemetery information (Church name, location, lat/lng) and this information is plotted on a Google Map, to "visualise" a particular record.

PHP, Google Maps and AngularJS, are also heavily used to pull, process and display the above information.
